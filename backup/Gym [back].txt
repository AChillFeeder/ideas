Pull with your elbows | Thumbless grip

Seated rows: Squeeze shoulder blades and then depress them | Torso isn't static, lean back slightly when pulling

[Get the feel]: Putting a middle size weight, getting it ALMOST full contraction, and just holding it and trying to feel what back muscle was working
Once you can feel it, focus on feeling it, make it tired, consciously try to relax your bicep while keeping the weight in the same place.
